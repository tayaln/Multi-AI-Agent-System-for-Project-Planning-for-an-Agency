Bob Smith takes on design tasks, but only a manageable number, while Jane Doe handles the majority of the implementation, which accounts for her specific skill set.\n","\n","3. **QA Team Utilization**: Both Alice Johnson and Tom Brown are allocated to quality assurance, ensuring adequate coverage for testing, which is critical before the project's finalization, with shared responsibility to avoid overwhelm.\n","\n","4. **Project Management**: John Doe, as the Project Manager, is assigned to the final review and launch task, ensuring he is involved in the project's culmination and can manage final adjustments.\n","\n","5. **Milestone Tracking**: Milestones have been established to monitor progress throughout the project phases, ensuring that each phase meets its deadlines before moving to the next, thus facilitating smooth transitions and effective risk management. \n","\n","By carefully analyzing skills and availability, this allocation aims not only for an
